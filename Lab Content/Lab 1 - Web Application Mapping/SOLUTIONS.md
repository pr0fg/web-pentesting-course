### Challenge 1
The Apache version can be found by CURLing a page on the webserver and inspecting the headers:

`curl -I http://container-ip:8080/`

Revealing the version `Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`


### Challenges 2 & 3
Users on the system can be identified since Apache's user directory module is enabled. To identify users, we can brute-force usernames by accessing the path `/~username/`

Using a wordlist of common names, we can identify the users `bob` and `jane` at paths `/~bob/` and `/~jane/`, respectively. Access their content to receive the flags.


### Challenge 4
Open indexing is enabled on this server. You can find an open index under `/backup` that contains an old version of `index.php` called `index.php.bak`. Download this file to see the flag.


### Challenge 5
An old script at `/test.php` reveals a full phpinfo() dump that contains the flag.


### Challenges 6 & 7 
A test version of `index.php` exists in the root directory under `/index2.php`. When accessed, the flag is given. To receive the flag for challenge 7, add the parameter `debug` to the URL to receive the flag. This can be done by going to URL `/index2.php&debug=1`


### Challenge 8
Discover the `/plugins` folder with an exposed index containing the file `test.php`. Call the URL `/plugins/test.php` to receive the flag.


### Challenge 9
An exposed Git folder exists on the server under `/.git`. Access it to receive the flag.


### Challenge 10
View the `/robots.txt` file to reveal a hidden file at `/test777.php`. Call that URL to receive the flag.
