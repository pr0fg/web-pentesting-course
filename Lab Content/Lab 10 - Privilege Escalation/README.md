Lab 10 - Privilege Escalation
======


### Pre-Lab Notes
This web service is available on port `8080`!


### Challenges
1. Use the vulnerable ping function to gain access to the webserver. Using your knowledge of privilege escalation, connect to the MySQL server using the credentials you discover and read the flag located at `/var/lib/mysql-files/flag.txt`. Note that the webserver user doesn't have read permissions for this file, so you'll need to read the file via MySQL.

2. Using information gathered in Challenge 1 (via MySQL), SSH into the server using the `admin` account. Note that the SSH server you need to access is running on port `2222`. Read the flag file found in the working directory.

3. Note that the server hosting the SSH server is actually a Docker container and the docker socket on the host (`/var/run/docker.sock`) has been mounted into the SSH server's container. Research how break out of the container into the host system by using this exposed socket file. The third flag is located on the **host** system at `/root/labs/lab10/config/flag3.txt`. 


### Lab Setup
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
