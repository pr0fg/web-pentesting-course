Lab 4 - Broken Authentication
======

#### Challenge
There are many misconfigurations within this user management portal, causing the system to leak information or allow the brute-forcing of usernames and credentials. 

Attempt to login to all of the user accounts on the system!

- Challenge 1: Find the account left over from the development process 

- Challenge 2: Find one hidden account

- Challenge 3: Identify the username of the standard user registered in the system 

- Challenge 4: Log in as the user found in challenge 3 

- Challenge 5: Log in via the administrator's account with the name `admin`

- Challenge 6: Log in as a student after registering using their student ID 


You should also attempt to register as an existing student (using a valid student ID) and then break into their account. Remember, you must register using their ID first!
