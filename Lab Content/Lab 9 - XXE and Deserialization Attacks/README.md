Lab 9 - XXE and Deserialization Attacks
======


### Pre-Lab Notes
This lab's web applications are available on ports `8080` and `8081`!


### Challenges
1. Manipulate the XML-based web search application on port `8080` to read the flag located at `/flag.txt`.

2. Manipulate the XML-based web search application on port `8080` to perform SSRF and read the flag located at `http://backend.example.com`.

3. Manipulate the XML-based feedback application on port `8081` to read the flag located at `/flag.txt`. This application is vulnerable to blind XXE, so you'll need to exfiltrate the file to a server under you control in order to read the file's contents.


### Lab Setup
```bash
docker-compose up
```
