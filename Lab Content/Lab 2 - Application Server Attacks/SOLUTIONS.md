### Challenge 1
An old script at `/test.php` reveals a full phpinfo() dump that contains the flag in an environmental variable.


### Challenge 2
Open indexing is enabled on this server and wordpress (was) installed at one point. You can find an open index under `/wp-content/plugins` that contains a directory called `wp-database-backup`, indicating the plugin name.


### Challenge 3
Some additional research about how the `wp-database-backup` works will reveal that it saves backups under `/wp-content/uploads/db-backup`. Since open indexing is enabled, browse to this folder to see the backup file.


### Challenge 4
A test folder exists under `/test` and contains a PHP file called `db.php`. If you call that file by going to `/test/db.php`, you'll see it gives an error indicating that a parameter called `queryTerm` is missing. 

Submit a `queryTerm` value using POST to receive the flag:
```bash
curl -X POST --data 'queryTerm=1' http://container-ip/test/db.php
```

### Challenge 5
Using a brute-force utility, identify the WebDAV folder at `/webdav`. We know that we should have access to a file called `passwd.dav`. In your browser, visit `/webdav/passwd.dav` to reveal a password authentication prompt.

The username is `user` and password is `password`. Use CURL to delete the resource by doing:
```bash
curl -X DELETE --user 'user:password' --digest http://localhost:8888/webdav/passwd.dav 
```

To receive the flag, visit `/challenge5.php` as per the instructions.


### Challenge 6
Tomcat is running on port 8080. Visit the URL `http://container-ip:8080/manager/html` to access the admin panel. 

Brute-force the username and password to reveal the credentials `tomcat` `qwerty`. The version information for JVM is at the bottom of this page.
