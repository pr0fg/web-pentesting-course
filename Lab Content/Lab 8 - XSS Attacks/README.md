Lab 8 - XSS Attacks
======


### Pre-Lab Notes
The web application (with all challenges) is available on port `8080`!


### Challenges
1. Identify the DOM-based XSS vulnerability. Create a working link that redirects the user to a phishing page (you can use google.com as a proof of concept).

2. Identify the reflected XSS vulnerability. Create a working link that sends the user's cookie to a remote server.

3. Exploit the first stored XSS vulnerability located at '/'. Create a working payload that sends the user's cookie to a remote server.

4. Exploit the second stored XSS vulnerability located at '/viewPost.php'. Create a working payload that sends the user's cookie to a remote server.

5. Exploit the third stored XSS vulnerability located at '/messages.php'. Create a working payload that sends the user's cookie to a remote server.
